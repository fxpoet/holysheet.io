# HolySheet.IO: Shortcut sheet Organizer with Claude AI spoonfeeding setup

To survive the job competition against AI Robot,

you must at least use shortcuts to increase your productivity and speed.

Many people try to learn shortcuts. Even in the 21st century,
they're stuck in an endless cycle of searching blogs, organizing, editing, printing, and getting exhausted,
eventually giving up on remembering and trashing the shortcut cheat sheets.

We need a brain-dead easy anti-exhaustion note tool.

that's why HolySheet was born: to save humanity.

## FAQ

- Yes, of course, a standalone desktop program version is coming soon.
- This was created in a week, so it has many shortcomings. But it should improve in the coming weeks.
- A Mac version is also planned. For now, if you tell Claude it's for Mac shortcuts, it will create them accordingly."



## ðŸ’Œ Dear Claude Contest

> ðŸŒŸHolySheet is an old idea of mine.
> realized that mixing Claude with my old ideas makes them even more amazing.
> On July 3rd, I found out about the Claude Contest through Facebook,
> and the contest became a great motivation to put this project into real action.

> Releasing the project within a week was a challenge.
> I could have thought of better configurations, like using pre-collected software shortcuts and RAG and caching etc..
> but because the contest duration was short, I focused on completion first.

> This program is not just a one-time showcase demo project for the contest only.
> It's a program I created out of my necessity, and it is planned to be offered as a public freeware service.
> Personally, I'm a bit hesitant about public release due to the cost of LLM calls.
> Therefore, giving me an award will complete the final piece of the puzzle.
> The fate of humanity now rests in the hands of the Claude judges!
